"Jul 5, 2025","Code Coach, A Personal Coding Agent ($49/mo)","['‚è∞Perfect Timing', '‚ö°Unfair Advantage', 'üåçMassive Market']","Most developers are basically professional prompt engineers who panic when Claude stops responding. They use Cursor and v0 like magic wands without understanding why the code works, just 'tab' 'tab' 'tab' and YOLO-ing code into production. Code Coach is like having that annoying senior dev who actually explains things, except it never judges you for asking ""what does this do?"" for the tenth time.

This AI agent watches you code and calls out your mistakes before they become disasters. Writing insecure code? It taps you on the shoulder. ""You sure??"" About to create a function that'll crash with 1000 users? It suggests a better approach and explains why your original idea was doomed. It's basically the voice in your head that prevents you from becoming the developer everyone secretly hates working with.

Here's how I'd grow it:

Create content showing ""I saved $200/month in Claude tokens by writing better prompts"" with dashboards proving how good code practices reduce AI debugging sessions and re-prompting cycles.
Partner with coding YouTubers to review their viewers' code submissions live, showing how Code Coach catches issues they miss, then offer discount codes to their audience.
Launch freemium model: basic suggestions free, then ""Actually Get Good"" ($29/mo), ""Senior Dev Insights"" ($49/mo), and ""Team Code Reviews"" ($149/mo for teams).
Create a public leaderboard showing anonymous code quality improvements over time, letting developers flex their progress and creating FOMO for those still writing spaghetti code.

While other developers are still asking Claude to explain why their code broke again, Code Coach users actually understand what they're building.
